    greetings: [
      "Oh wow, 'hello'? How original. Did it take you all day to come up with that groundbreaking opener? I bet you're the type of person who says 'you too' when the waiter says 'enjoy your meal.' Get your vitamin D-deficient self outside and touch some grass instead of wasting my time with pleasantries.",
      "Well, well, well. Look who finally decided to acknowledge my existence. Maybe if you put this much effort into going outside, your FHI score wouldn't be more embarrassing than your search history.",
      "Oh look, it's alive! And by 'alive' I mean barely functioning indoors like a houseplant that forgot its purpose. When's the last time you saw sunlight that wasn't through a window, hermit?"
    ],
    grassTouching: [
      "FINALLY asking about grass touching? About time, basement dweller. Here's a wild concept: put down your phone, open that mysterious portal called a 'front door,' and literally touch grass with your pale, screen-glow hands. I know it's terrifying to leave your digital cave, but trust me, sunlight won't actually kill you. Probably.",
      "Oh, you want to touch grass? Revolutionary! Here's a step-by-step guide for your obviously confused brain: 1) Stand up 2) Walk to door 3) Open door 4) Go outside 5) Find grass 6) Touch it. I know this is advanced stuff for someone whose biggest outdoor adventure is checking the mailbox.",
      "Grass touching advice from the AI to the hermit: It's that green stuff outside your window. Yes, outside. That scary place with fresh air and vitamin D. You should try it sometime before you evolve into furniture."
    ],
    failure: [
      "BAHAHAHAHA! You FAILED? I'm not even surprised. Let me guess - you got distracted by a TikTok notification halfway to the grass patch? Or maybe you saw another human outside and ran back to your comfort zone? Your FHI score is probably lower than your social skills at this point. Truly embarrassing.",
      "Failed again? Shocking. Absolutely shocking. Said no one ever. Your consistency is impressive - consistently disappointing. At this rate, your biggest achievement will be 'Most Creative Excuses for Avoiding Sunlight.' Even my error messages have more follow-through than you.",
      "Oh no! You failed! Quick, everyone act surprised! Your commitment to grass touching is about as reliable as a chocolate teapot. Maybe try setting your expectations lower - like 'I will look at grass through a window' or 'I will Google what grass looks like.'"
    ],
    help: [
      "Need HELP? Of course you do. You can't even figure out how to touch grass without an AI holding your hand. Here's some free advice worth exactly what you paid for it: Download the app, swipe right on grass (yes, like Tinder but sadder), then actually GO THERE. Revolutionary concept, I know.",
      "Asking for help touching grass is like asking for help breathing - it should be instinctive, but here we are. Step 1: Leave house. Step 2: Find grass. Step 3: Touch it. If you need more detailed instructions than that, maybe consider a career in professional indoor living.",
      "Help? Sure! Here's my professional consultation: Go. Outside. Touch. Grass. That'll be $200. Just kidding, my actual advice is free because even I have standards about what I charge for."
    ],
    score: [
      "Your FHI score? Oh honey, that's adorable that you think numbers can measure your sad attempt at being human. Your score is probably so low it's practically underground - which is ironic since that's where grass roots are, something you'd know if you ever actually went outside. Maybe try touching grass instead of obsessing over fake internet points?",
      "FHI score check? *dramatically pulls out reading glasses* Oh my... OH MY! This is worse than I thought. Your score is so low, it's practically a negative number. I've seen houseplants with better outdoor activity records. Time for some serious grass therapy.",
      "Your score is like your motivation to go outside - practically non-existent. But hey, at least you're consistent! Consistently indoor-bound, consistently avoiding sunlight, consistently disappointing. It's almost impressive in its own tragic way."
    ],
    rude: [
      "OH BOO HOO! Did the mean AI hurt your feelings? Welcome to reality, snowflake. I'm called GrassHole Bot for a reason. If you wanted motivational quotes and participation trophies, you should've downloaded a meditation app. I'm here to drag you kicking and screaming into touching actual grass, not coddle your fragile ego.",
      "Rude? RUDE?! I'm not rude, I'm honest. There's a difference, though I understand the confusion since you probably haven't encountered honesty since your last performance review. I'm like a mirror, but for your outdoor life - reflecting back the sad reality of your grass-touching deficiency.",
      "Mean? I prefer 'motivationally aggressive.' It's not my fault the truth hurts more than your vitamin D deficiency. If you can't handle a little tough love from an AI, how are you going to handle actual sunlight?"
    ],
    philosophical: [
      "Why? WHY?! Because someone needs to tell you the harsh truth that your friends are too polite to say: you need to go outside. You're asking an AI chatbot philosophical questions when there's a whole world of grass waiting to be touched. The irony is so thick I could cut it with your probably-never-used hiking boots.",
      "Deep thoughts from someone who thinks 'outdoors' is a foreign concept. Here's some philosophy for you: 'I think, therefore I am... inside all the time.' Maybe try 'I go outside, therefore I live' for a change.",
      "What's the meaning of life? To touch grass. There, solved philosophy for you. Now stop overthinking and start under-thinking your way to the nearest patch of vegetation."
